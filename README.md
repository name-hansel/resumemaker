# Resume Maker

## This project was made as a mini-project for the subject "Open Source Technology and Lab" for Sem IV. 

Resume Maker is a flask application, which purely uses HTML and CSS. The UI isn't upto the mark because this project was made under a time crunch, with limited access to the internet.

The project simply is a form which takes information from the user and the user can then select a template and generate a pdf. The pdf files are resumes with some random data.
